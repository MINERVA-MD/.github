Minerva is a markdown editor that supports real-time collaborative
editing and seamless integration with GitHub. We are building Minerva by leveraging our GitHub Community. We've helped over 2.5 million developers from over 50 countries ü§Ø. 
But that's just us. We are proud to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system ü™ê. Yes, [Robots](https://github.com/readme/featured/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter)!

### Issues
#### Creating a new issue

Otherwise, feel free to open a new issue. Make sure you provide a clear and detailed explaination of the issue. Provide your operating system and software version so that others can more easily replicate the issue.

#### Solving an issue
Scan through our repos for existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. 

As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a **pull request** with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.

-   Using GitHub Desktop:

    -   [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
    -   Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

-   Using the command line:

    -   [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

-   GitHub Codespaces:
    -   [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. For more information, see [the development guide](contributing/development.md).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to know how to use emoji for commit messages.

<!-- Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:. -->

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

<!-- -   Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. -->

-   Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
-   Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
    Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
-   We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
-   As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
-   If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

## An Integrated Community

The open-source community is the heart of Minerva, and it acts as a milestone in how an amazing markdown editor is created with the support of people from around the world.

* Minerva has helped students attending BCIT create a professional project and profile readme(s).
* Every line of code created through the help of our collaborators has helped us grow and allow our application to be free for educational & professional use.
* We‚Äôve helped over 100 users so far, and we‚Äôre continually growing our numbers every day.

As we expand to a larger audience, we hope to build a community of like-minded individuals that want to create something really special. We want to embrace all levels of developers to partake in a community of the brightest minds in the industry.

Additionally, we have growing communities on several platforms like Reddit, and Discord, and we‚Äôre looking to expand to other platforms too. We want people from around the world to find out about our product so that they can find a workflow that works for them.

We just want to thank everyone in the community.
